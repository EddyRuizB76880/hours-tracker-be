# Hours Tracker
This is a project in progress where I will put in practice what I learnt in [NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) to create a backend that will expose multiple REST APIs.

In costarrican universities, students are required to do a total of 300 hours worth of community service within a year to graduate. This project is about creating a web application that will allow students log activities and time spent in each to keep track of their progress. 

A front-end project in React will be done as well.
